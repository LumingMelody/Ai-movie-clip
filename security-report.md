# Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This security audit of the AI Movie Clip codebase identified **18 distinct security vulnerabilities** across multiple severity levels. The most critical findings include hardcoded API keys in version control, overly permissive CORS configuration, and extensive credential exposure in configuration files. While the application doesn't use a traditional database (reducing SQL injection risks), there are significant concerns around credential management, input validation, and security configurations that require immediate attention.

**Risk Assessment**: HIGH - Multiple critical and high-severity vulnerabilities present immediate security risks.

## Critical Vulnerabilities
